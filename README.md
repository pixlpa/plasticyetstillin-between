=========================

This is the source code of [Plastic Yet Still In-Between](https://pixlpa.com/plasticyetstillinbetween/), a web-based group exhibition (Pavilion) created for The Wrong Biennale in 2013. I taught myself WebGL in the process of building this site, which includes 3D navigation, framebuffer glitch effects, procedural geometry, 2D jQuery/CSS stuff, and interactions with embedded media.

The main WebGL loop and initialization is in the index.html file, with a lot of the prototypes and functions in the files inside the "js" directory. The "simple" site was developed as a fallback for browsers without WebGL support.
